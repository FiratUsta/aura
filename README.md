Aura is a minimal, customizable and keyboard/command centric startpage designed to be used alongside with browser extensions such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/">New Tab Override</a>  in order to have a personalized startpage without the hassle of self-hosting.

It's especially useful if you want to use the same startpage with multiple machines/browsers as the list of links and the theme can be changed on a per-browser basis without needing to touch any HTML or hosting multiple versions.

It's import/export capabilities also provide an easy way of transferring link lists or custom themes between machines, browsers or users.

To start using Aura, head over to the live page and set it as your homepage/new tab page.
